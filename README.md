This is a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) project bootstrapped with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment.
uv venv
# Activate the virtual environment.
source .venv/Scripts/activate
# Sync the project's dependencies with the environment.
uv sync
# Run a command in the project environment.
uv run fastapi dev src/app/main.py
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the API by modifying `src/app/main.py`. The server auto-updates as you edit the file.
